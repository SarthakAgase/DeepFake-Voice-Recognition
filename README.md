# DeepFake Voice Recognition

## Overview

Welcome to the DeepFake Voice Recognition project repository! This project focuses on utilizing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to extract features from audio samples and employs the Random Forest algorithm for the classification of voices into fake and real categories. The primary goal is to develop an effective tool for detecting deepfake voices in audio recordings.

## Features

- **MFCC Feature Extraction:** The project leverages MFCC to capture the spectral characteristics of audio signals, providing a robust representation for voice features.

- **Random Forest Classification:** The classification model is built using the Random Forest algorithm, known for its versatility and effectiveness in handling complex datasets.

## Project Overview

Welcome to the DeepFake Voice Recognition project! This repository focuses on utilizing Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment, to implement voice recognition for detecting deepfake voices. The project leverages Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to extract features from audio data and employs the Random Forest algorithm for the classification of voices as either real or fake.
